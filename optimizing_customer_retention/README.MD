### Case Study: Optimizing Customer Retention for a Subscription-Based Business

#### Scenario: 
You are working with a subscription-based e-commerce company that delivers curated health and wellness products to customers every month. The company operates in multiple regions and is facing challenges with customer retention. They have noticed an increasing trend of customer churn over the last two quarters. The company believes that improving their retention strategy could significantly boost profitability and long-term customer satisfaction. As a data scientist, your role is to analyze the problem using data and recommend a strategy to minimize churn.

### Prompts
#### Understanding the Problem
1. What key metrics would you track to measure churn and customer retention effectively?
2. What factors could influence customer churn in a subscription-based business model?

#### Descriptive Statistics
Summarize the key statistics for each variable. For example:
1. What is the average monthly spend of customers who churned vs. those who didn't?
2. What is the distribution of tenure across regions?

Identify any patterns or trends associated with churn:
1. Does churn vary significantly by region?
2. Are customers with higher complaints more likely to churn?

Identify relationships between variables:
1. Is there a correlation between tenure and churn?
2. Does the number of promotions availed impact churn?

Use the dataset to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn. The model can use features such as:

- Region
- Tenure
- Monthly Spend
- Complaints Filed
- Promotions Availed

#### Model Building
1. Discuss how you would:

- Choose features for the model.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., using accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score).

2. After building the model, explain which features are most important in predicting churn and why.

#### Strategic Recommendations
1. Based on your analysis, suggest strategies the company could implement to reduce churn. For example:
- Incentivizing long-tenure customers.
- Targeted promotions for high-risk customers (based on model predictions).
- Resolving common customer complaints.

2. Experimentation
- Propose an experiment to test the effectiveness of your recommendations (e.g., an A/B test for a new retention strategy).
